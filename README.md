## Project Descriptions

### 1. Radiation Shielding and Transport
This project focuses on the interaction of gamma radiation with matter. The study involves designing and optimizing transport containers for radioisotopes, specifically comparing the attenuation efficiency (HVL/TVL) of various materials such as Lead and Tungsten.

### 2. Geiger-Müller Detector Instrumentation
The goal of this simulation is to model the response of gas-filled detectors. It includes the simulation of primary and secondary ionization processes to determine detector efficiency curves and analyze pulse height distributions.

### 3. Clinical Dosimetry and Radiotherapy
This study examines energy deposition within water phantoms for oncological applications. Key objetives include the visualization of the Bragg Peak and the analysis of dose distribution according to different particle types and initial energy profiles.

### 4. Neutron Moderation and Reactor Theory 
This project explores the process of neutron thermalization within different moderating materials. The simulation evaluates scattering cross-sections and the resulting shift in the neutron energy spectrum, fundamental for research reactor physics.
